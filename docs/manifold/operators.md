# Operators

In many cases, we wish to define operators on the manifold. Most notably, we are interested in being able to compute the exterior derivative (gradient), the divergence, and the Laplacian.

!!! note "Coming soon..."

    We also need to add the ability to compute the curl on the manifold.
